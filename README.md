## Problem Statement: 
Millions of individuals lack timely access to accurate and affordable healthcare, leading to delayed diagnoses and potentially worse health outcomes. Existing medical imaging diagnosis relies heavily on specialist interpretation, creating bottlenecks and access limitations. Patients often lack comprehensive information about their potential conditions, adding to confusion and anxiety.

**The current healthcare system faces critical challenges**:

* **Limited access to specialists:** Long wait times for specialist appointments delay diagnosis and treatment, especially in underserved communities.
* **Information asymmetry:** Patients often lack clear and accessible information about potential health issues, leading to confusion and anxiety.
* **Reactive diagnoses:** Traditional healthcare focuses on diagnosing illness after symptoms appear, hindering preventive measures.

**We need a revolutionary solution that empowers individuals to proactively manage their health and bridge the gap between patients and specialists.**

* **Provides self-service health assessments using easily accessible scans (kidney, brain, lung) and AI-powered analysis for early detection of potential abnormalities (cysts, stones, tumors, tuberculosis).**
* **Empowers individuals with readily understandable information on potential causes, symptoms, and treatment options for identified conditions.**
* **Offers an AI medical assistant for guidance and clarification, reducing reliance on specialist consultations for initial assessments.**
* **Facilitates direct booking of appointments with healthcare professionals for confirmed diagnosis and follow-up care.**

 ## Solution: üí°  
The above factors contribute to delayed interventions, anxiety, and potential worsening of health outcomes. Health Oracle emerges as a groundbreaking solution, empowering individuals to take charge of their health through a user-centric, AI-powered application.
